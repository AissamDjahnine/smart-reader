# Improvements Backlog

This file tracks lightweight product/UI improvement ideas when requested.

## Streak Badge Icon Ideas

- Default icon: `Flame` (current choice)
  - Why: instantly communicates streak momentum.
  - Keep compact (`14px`) and lightweight in header.

- Alternative icons to test:
  - `Zap` for a sharper "energy" feeling.
  - `CalendarCheck` for a more neutral productivity tone.
  - `Trophy` for milestone-focused streak celebration.

- Visual variants to evaluate:
  - Color by state:
    - Active streak (`orange`)
    - No streak (`gray`)
  - Optional pulse animation only on milestone days (7, 30, 100).
  - Optional tooltip copy:
    - "Read today to keep your streak alive."

## Reading Stats Backlog

- Reintroduce a redesigned `Heatmap` mode in `Reading activity` after visual cleanup.
  - Keep it optional in the activity view switch.
  - Improve density/contrast so it feels lighter and less crowded.
